help_title_1	How to play
help_content_1_1	In order to purchase a ticket, you’ll need to have an Ethereum wallet. For help creating one, visit $1
help_content_1_2	On the homepage, click on the lottery you wish to play.

Clicking on the trash can icon will remove your selected numbers and the magic wand will once again appear as an option.
help_content_1_3	Once you’re satisfied with the number selection, click on the “buy” button to purchase your ticket. You will be prompted to either pay with MetaMask (a secure Chrome plugin that is recommended for use with myetherwallet.com) or to transfer funds directly from your Ethereum wallet to the lottery smart contract address (for more advanced users).
help_content_1_4	After the purchase, if you’re still feeling lucky, go back and buy more tickets – there is no waiting period and no limit to the number of lottery tickets you can buy.
